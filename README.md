# HLS-Sigmoid
This work designs a modular approximation methodology for efficient fixed-point hardware implementation of the sigmoid function. Based on Newton-Raphson method, our method can make a good balance among the objectives of approximation accuracy, hardware resource utilization, and performance. Our work is in [DOI:10.1109/TIE.2022.3146573](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700744)



The method is friendly for hardware implementation and verified with Xilinx HLS code in *code-HLS* directory. Some snapshots of experiment are in *report.pptx*.
